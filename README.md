# ESP-Badge

This is a fork of ESP-Face and is intended to be a component which provides functions of #badgelife badge detection and #badgelife badge recognition, and also operations of neurual network (I guess - idk I just forked this shit bruh).

It can be used as a component of some project as it doesn't support any interface of periphrals.

By default, it works along with ESP-WHO, which is a project-level repository.

## Badge detection

We can't do that yet.

## Face recognition

Can't do that yet either.  Come back later.

## Deep learning library

All neural network operations are defined in this library. They are and only are utilized for neural network.

The library contains basic matrix operations, basic deep neural network operations, network structures, and coefficients.

More details are [HERE](lib/README.md)

For the implementation of a simple network, [here](tutorial/implement_your_own_model.ipynb) is the tutorial.
